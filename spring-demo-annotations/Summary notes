SUMMARY NOTES

Scopes:
* By default all beans created are singletons
* To specify bean scope use the @Scope("singleton") annotation -> 'singleton' is for example

* Singleton scope: reference to the single bean is shared by all things that request it - only one in the spring container. When you ask for the 
	bean you get the same reference back.
* Prototype scope: new object for each request of the bean

Context XML file:
<!-- add entry to enable component scanning -->
	<context:component-scan base-package="com.katsa.springdemo"></context:component-scan>
	
<!-- Load properties file -->	
	<context:property-placeholder location="classpath:fortunes.properties"/>
	
Annotations:

* @Component - causes the bean to be created automatically with default bean id -> class name with first letter lowercase
* @Autowired - automatic dependency injection
			 - Can be used for constructors, setters or any method or fields
			 - field injection happens by using java reflection :/
			 
* @Value("${katsa.fortune2}") - > field injection of value from a properties file, it can also be an explicit value.
* @Qualifier("happyFortuneService") -> Allows you to specify which implementation of a specific interface to inject

@PostConstruct - add to method to be executed just after bean is created
@PreDestroy - add to method to be called before bean is destroyed - i.e so you can do some cleanup

NOTE!!
For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method. 
From Spring docs: In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a
prototype bean: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a
prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype
instance.
